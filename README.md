# Lendify

Webapp designed in the context of EngHack 2018 in a team of 4. Lendify is similar to Shoppify or craiglist except that it is a borrow/lending webapp that functions based on a collateral system that is managed in its entirety by a smart contract using the Ethereum blockchain in order to avoid having a third party managing financial transactions and maintain accountability. 

Its stack consists of Solidity used to create a smart contract on the Ethereum Network, Node.js combined with MongoDB for the backend as well as Bootstrap combined with ejs for the frontend.
